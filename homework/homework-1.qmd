title: "Problem set 1"
---

This is a problem set designed to make sure you've got the basics of R down. Feel free to

1. have a look at the .qmd file of this document to get another example,
2. use the starter template at [https://github.com/recap-org/template-r-small](https://github.com/recap-org/template-r-small) for a clean starting setup. 

You must complete this problem set entirely on your own. We want to see the code that you wrote to get there, so Be sure to that your code chunks are visible in your output (they should be by default). See this qmd file if you have no clue what we're talking about. 

```{r}
#| label: hidden-chunk
#| echo: false

# this chunk has echo set to false so that the setup code doesn't show up in the output
```

```{r}
#| label: visible-chunk

# This chunk is visible, because it has not set echo.
# (open the .qmd file to see what I'm talking about).
# Because echo is not set, it takes the default value (true)
# So the chunk is shown in the output.
```


## Problem 1: Build a fake dataset.

Create a fake `data.frame` (or `tibble`) of at least 10 observations and 5 columns, including the following:

1. One variable that is a `logical` (e.g., TRUE/FALSE).
2. One variable is a `character`.
3. One variable is `numeric`.
5. Each variable should have a reasonable name.
6. Each row should be unique.
7. Each column should have variation (e.g. a column can't be all 1's).
8. BONUS: One variable that is a date (hint: `as.Date()`)
9. BONUS: One variable that is a phone number (hint: find the `charlatan` package)

## Problem 2: Basic data manipulation and summary.

Load the dataset [tik_tok_data.csv](/data/homework-1-tiktok.csv), located on the class site.

1. What is the mean number of views?

2. What is the variance of the number of views?

3. How many different users are in the data? How many videos from each user are contained in the data? (Hint: `unique()`)

4. How many users have zero shares? What are the names of users with zero-shares videos?

5. Report the average number of views for the user **timesaver9000**; do the same for **lindsaynikole**. Who has a higher average number of views?

6. Calculate the standard error for the mean of the number of views for **timesaver9000** and **lindsaynikole**. Which has the lower standard error? Describe why the standard error is lower in terms of variance and sample size.

## Problem 3: Did soccer really get less exciting over time? (BONUS)

Load the dataset [lecture-1-england.csv](/data/lecture-1-england.csv), located on the class site

1. Report the average number of goals for the 1890's and 2010's decades. Which decade had more goals on average?
2. Calculate the confidence interval for the mean number of goals in the 1890's and 2010's decades. 
3. Do these confidence intervals overlap? 

<!-- 7. Using the "overlapping confidence intervals" approach, test the hypothesis that **timesaver9000** and **lindsaynikole** have different average numbers of views. -->

<!-- 8. Using the `t.test()` function, test the same hypothesis above. Interpret its output in detail. -->

<!-- ## Problem 3: Writing Functions -->

<!-- 1. Write a function to convert pounds to kilograms. -->

<!-- 2. Write a function to convert pounds to kilograms, or kilograms to pounds. -->

<!-- 3. Write a function to convert any of pounds, kilograms, stone, or gram to any of the other units. Start by thinking about what arguments your function should take. There should be 3. -->




End of HW1. Make sure to submit both your .qmd file and output, either as a self-contained HTML or PDF file (this file, as well as the starter template at [https://github.com/recap-org/template-r-small](https://github.com/recap-org/template-r-small) are set up to output self-contained HTML files). And if you need help, remember the rule: if you can't figure out a coding issue after spending 30 minutes and Googling, EMAIL US.

Good luck!
